Joined along the way by a few friends and their aging fathers here and there, Sue and Sara experience the trip of a lifetime. They fall in love with the world, cultivate an appreciation for home, and discover who, or what, they want to become.It's Only the Himalayas is the incredibly funny, sometimes outlandish, always entertaining confession of a young backpacker that will inspire you to take your own adventure. ...more",

For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ark following the Great Flood.
